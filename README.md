# JAHRepository
These are five of my p5js assignments from my media arts class. Highlighted in these projects are my implementation of sound in project 10 as well as the use of parameters to make objects bounce off of canvas borders. I believe these to be some of my best coding work since high school computer science - and they were very fun to make!
